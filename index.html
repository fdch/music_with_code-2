<p>Times: TBD</p>
<p>Location: Studio</p>
<p>Instructor: Fede Camara Halac</p>
<hr />
<p>Here is the course <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a></p>
<p>In this class we will learn to make music with code, once again. As
composers, performers, or educators you will learn how to use code to
generate symbolic and audio music fragments that you can use in your
music. We will also use this class to learn the basics of <a
href="https://tidalcycles.org/">TidalCycles</a>, <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">The
Web Audio API</a>, network music software, and more!</p>
<p>If you have quesions about those things, send me an email (see
below).</p>
<p>We wil be coding a huge lot, but we'll start with the basics. You
might want to make yourself acquainted with a good text editor. You
don't need to have previous experience with programming languages. If
you do have experience with these languages, then the class should be
informative because of the specific tools and techniques relating to
music making we will be covering. And there's all that crazy music
programming stuff we will try to set loose. During the term, if you are
having serious problems, please come to talk to me so that I can work
with you or adjust the syllabus to get things back on-track.</p>
<p>The ultimate objective is to create a small piece of music using
SuperCollider.</p>
<h1 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h1>
<p>TBD</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="structure">Structure</h1>
<p>Class meets on ...</p>
<p>We may make a few assignments throughout the term, mainly to spur
class discussion. Hopefully some of the assignments may lead to your
final projects for the class.</p>
<p>We will have several guest speakers in the class during the term.
Watch for announcements on the <a href="syllabus.html">course
syllabus</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="facilities">Facilities</h1>
<p>Nearly all of the Studio space and hardware resources are available
for you to use. If you prefer to work on your own computer, that's
perfectly fine. Otherwise you may sign up studios and machines for doing
your work at the Studio using our <a href="index.html">on-line signup
system</a>. If you are having trouble getting access to the hardware or
software you need, please let us know.</p>
<div class="line-block">Again, please let us know if you are having
problems getting equipment or software to work for you. In general, if
you are having difficulty understanding the programming paradigms we are
using or the applications and information we are covering. be sure to
talk to us. We'll be happy to sit down and work through any issues with
you.</div>
<hr />
<h1 id="syllabus">Syllabus</h1>
<p>The course syllabus is located <a href="syllabus.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>We will put each class on its own website every week and link to it
on the main syllabus page. We'll try to keep up with linking in class
patches, examples and information, but we may fall behind. Please let us
know when we do.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="contact-information">Contact Information</h1>
<p>The best way to reach us is through e-mail: camarafede at gmail dot
com</p>
<p>I will be holding office hours from 2-6 on Tuesdays, 9-12.30 Wed and
Thursdays. I will also usually be around before or after class, in
addition to being around the Studio on various days. If it looks like we
need to schedule some more formal sessions for additional info, we
will.</p>
<p>It's always a good idea to make an appointment to see me, even during
my purported office hours, because I often have to run around campus
like a maniac doing strange, computer-music stuff.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="grades">Grades</h1>
<p>Grades will be based mainly on the final projects you do. We will
discuss projects as the semester progresses. As noted above, we may be
making some assignments throughout the term and discussing these in
class. It'a always fun to see what you all can do.</p>
<p>I believe at this point in your career the last thing you should be
worrying about is a grade. The main thing is to find something that
you'd really like to do and then do it.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the class!</p>
