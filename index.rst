Times: TBD

Location: Studio

Instructor: Fede Camara Halac

Here is the course `syllabus <syllabus.html>`_

In this class we will learn to make music with code, once again.
As composers, performers, or educators you will learn how to use code to generate symbolic and audio music fragments that you can use in your music.
We will also use this class to learn the basics of `TidalCycles <https://tidalcycles.org/>`_, `The Web Audio API <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API>`_, network music software, and more!

If you have quesions about those things, send me an email (see below).

We wil be coding a huge lot, but we'll start with the basics.
You might want to make yourself acquainted with a good text editor.
You don't need to have previous experience with programming languages.
If you do have experience with these languages, then the class should be informative because of the specific tools and techniques relating to music making we will be covering.
And there's all that crazy music programming stuff we will try to set loose.
During the term, if you are having serious problems, please come to talk to me so that I can work with you or adjust the syllabus to get things back on-track.

The ultimate objective is to create a small piece of music using SuperCollider.

Structure
=========

Class meets on ...

We may make a few assignments throughout the term, mainly to spur class
discussion. Hopefully some of the assignments may lead to your final
projects for the class.

We will have several guest speakers in the class during the term.
Watch for announcements on the `course syllabus <syllabus.html>`__.

Facilities
==========

Nearly all of the Studio space and hardware resources are available for you to use.
If you prefer to work on your own computer, that's perfectly fine.
Otherwise you may sign up studios and machines for doing your work at the Studio using our `on-line signup system <index.html>`__.
If you are having trouble getting access to the hardware or software you need, please let us know.

| Again, please let us know if you are having problems getting equipment or software to work for you.
  In general, if you are having difficulty understanding the programming paradigms we are using or the applications and information we are covering. be sure to talk to us.
  We'll be happy to sit down and work through any issues with you.

Syllabus
========

The course syllabus is located `here <syllabus.html>`__.

We will put each class on its own website every week and link to it on the main syllabus page.
We'll try to keep up with linking in class patches, examples and information, but we may fall behind.
Please let us know when we do.

Contact Information
===================

The best way to reach us is through e-mail: camarafede at gmail dot com

I will be holding office hours from 2-6 on Tuesdays, 9-12.30 Wed and Thursdays.
I will also usually be around before or after class, in addition to being around the Studio on various days.
If it looks like we need to schedule some more formal sessions for additional info, we will.

It's always a good idea to make an appointment to see me, even during my
purported office hours.

----

Grades
======

Grades will be based mainly on the final projects you do.
We will discuss projects as the semester progresses.
As noted above, we may be making some assignments throughout the term and discussing these in class.
It'a always fun to see what you all can do.

I believe at this point in your career the last thing you should be worrying about is a grade.
The main thing is to find something that you'd really like to do and then do it.

Hope you enjoy the class!
